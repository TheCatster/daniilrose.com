# Personal Site Neo
My personal website which includes my CV, blog, projects, and
information about me. Built to be simple, and get the point across
efficiently. Hosted on my homelab.

Redesigned using React, Node, and tailwindcss to still be as minimal
as possible.

Next.js is used as a framework to more efficiently do what I
previously tried to implement from scratch.

Includes my CV, Emacs configuration, and more.
