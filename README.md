# Personal Site Neo
My personal website which includes my CV and information about
me. Built to be simple, and get the point across efficiently. Hosted
on my homelab.

Redesigned using React, Node, and tailwindcss to still be as minimal
as possible.

The frontend is located in `/frontend`, and contains the React pieces,
while `/backend` hosts the Node and Express backend.

Includes my CV, Emacs configuration, and more.
