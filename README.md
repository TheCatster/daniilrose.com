My portfolio and personal website. It contains an overview of who I am, my projects, and my resume. Built to be simple and effective. Hosted on my personal homelab!

After many different iterations of this site using strange frameworks and not-mainstream languages, I've decided to settle on the battle-tested React. I use Next.js, Tailwindcss, and Typescript.
