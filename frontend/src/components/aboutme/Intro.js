        My name is Daniel Rose. I am an embedded systems engineering student,
        with a passion for Lisp, Rust, and Data Science. Experimenting with
        robotic and mechatronic systems is also an interest of mine. I work as
        an apprentice satellite engineer, which includes mechanical and
        electrical components. I design PCBs and mechanical parts in CAD
        programs such as KiCad, Eagle, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360; I program my
        systems in the C, Rust, and Python languages, and do various
        calculations related to the physics of our units.

        I am a member of <em>Mensa</em>, the <em>Free Software Foundation</em>{" "}
        and the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em>. All my projects are GNU

        I pride myself in being as efficient and knowledgeable as is reasonable.
        This applies to all my work, whether it is programming, CAD design, or
        everyday life. I have strong communication skills, and utilise these to
        further my understanding of all topics.

        I have a blog called
        <a href="https://www.regressions.xyz">
          <em> regressions</em>
        </a>
        , where I discuss various mathematical concepts, computer knowledge, and
        Linux things (although finding time to write new articles can be
        challenging!).
