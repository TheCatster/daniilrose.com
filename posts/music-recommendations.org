Yikes, it again has been more than six months since I wrote a blog post. I
absolutely love recommending music to people (it makes my hours of discovery
each week actually useful!), and after being constantly asked "what's that
song?" and "wow I love that do you know more like that?" I decided it's time to
start writing about this.

My goal is to write a weekly summary of music I've found across numerous genres.
I hope to recommend albums and singles for all moods that I feel people would
enjoy, and eventually will put together a newsletter that you can subscribe to
for an automatic weekly update.

To start, I'll link my [[https://open.spotify.com/user/danya.scout][Spotify account]]
and say that my first few recommendations are coming soon!
