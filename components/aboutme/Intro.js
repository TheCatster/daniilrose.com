                My name is Daniil Rose. I am majoring in both Computer Engineering and German at Penn State University.
                I am passionate about Lisp, Rust, and hardware hacking. I have work experience with robotic systems using
                ROS, and experience programming UNIX systems that have gone to space!
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked over the summer as an intern at Peraton Remotec, helping design systems for robots using ROS.
                I created an encrypted quick-patch system for updating Remotec's robots easily. I previously
                worked as an embedded systems engineer at Quub, which
                included mechanical and electrical components at a satellite firm. I designed PCBs and
                mechanical parts in CAD programs such as KiCad, Eagle, SolidWorks, and
                Fusion 360, and programmed my systems in the C, Rust, and Python languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a member of the <em>Free Software Foundation</em>,{" "}
                the <em>IEEE</em> and the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em>. Most of my projects are GNU
                GPL v3.0 licensed, and I believe in the freedom of knowledge, as well as
                self-hosting and decentralisation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pride myself in being as efficient and knowledgeable as is reasonable.
                This applies to all my work, whether it is programming, CAD design, or
                everyday life. I have strong communication skills, and utilise these to
                further my understanding of all topics.
