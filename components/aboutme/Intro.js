                My name is Daniil Rose. I am dual-majoring in Computer Engineering and
                German at Penn State University. I am passionate about Operating
                Systems, Rust, and hardware hacking. I have experience in a variety of
                fields: from working with bomb-disposal robots using ROS and Bash, to
                experience programming cubesats that have gone to space!
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked over the summer as an intern at Peraton Remotec, helping design
                systems for robots using ROS. I created an encrypted quick-patch system
                for updating Remotec robots easily. I previously worked as an embedded
                systems engineer at Quub, a start-up satellite firm, which included
                mechanical and electrical components. I designed PCBs and mechanical
                parts in CAD programs such as KiCad, Eagle, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360,
                and programmed my systems in the C, Rust, and Python languages.

            <p>
                I am a member of the <em>Free Software Foundation</em>, the{" "}
                <em>IEEE</em> and the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em>. Most of
                my projects are GNU GPL v3.0 licensed, and I believe in the freedom of
                knowledge, as well as self-hosting and decentralisation.

                I pride myself in being as efficient and knowledgeable as is reasonable.
                This applies to all my work, whether it is programming, CAD design, or
                everyday life. I have strong communication skills, and utilise these to
                further my understanding of all topics and to work effectively with
                people of all different kinds of backgrounds.
