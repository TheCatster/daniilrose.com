                My name is Daniil Rose. I am an integrated undergraduate-graduate (IUG)
	    	student at The Pennsylvania State University (WE ARE!)- concurrently pursuing
	    	a master&apos;s in international affairs, a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering,
	    	and a Bachelor of Science in German under the supervision of

            At Penn State, I serve as the President of
	    	the 75th Assembly of the Graduate and Professional Student Association, or <em>GPSA</em>.
	    	I also have the honor of serving as the emcee for Penn State Homecoming (2025).
            </p>
	    <p>
	    	I am passionate about science and technology policy,
                and seek to use my experience in engineering and leadership to
                further the world of policy. In particular, I actively research the institutional management
                of the research enterprise through a semiotic lens.
                On the engineering side, I have experience in a variety of fields: from
                working on bomb-disposal robots (in partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory) to experience developing
                satellites that have gone to space!
            </p>
            <p>
                This past summer, I worked for 
                {" "}<Link className="text-orange-feels hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-gray-700" href="https://ieeeusa.org">IEEE</Link>{" "}
                in Washington D.C., writing a policy proposal about research translation.
                I previously interned at RTD Embedded Technologies and continued
                working there throughout the 2024 - 2025 school year, spearheading a new IoT
	    	product line, designing firmware for embedded systems and
                designing new processes to enable smoother operations for manufacturing.
                Before that, I worked as a systems engineering intern at Peraton Remotec, an embedded
                systems engineer at Quub, a start-up satellite firm, which included
                mechanical and electrical components. I designed PCBs and mechanical
                parts in CAD programs such as KiCad, Eagle, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360,
                and programmed my systems using the C, Rust, and Python languages.
